Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, is the process of analyzing textual data to identify and extract subjective information, such as emotions, opinions, and attitudes. It is widely applied in areas like customer feedback analysis, social media monitoring, and market research to understand public sentiment toward products, services, or events. 

Sentiment analysis plays a key role in decision-making, enabling businesses to gauge customer satisfaction, anticipate market trends, and improve user experience. While it can be performed manually for small datasets, automated methods using lexicon-based approaches or statistical techniques are crucial for scalability and efficiency when dealing with large volumes of text.
